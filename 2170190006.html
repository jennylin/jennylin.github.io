<dt>1998 - 2000</dt><dd>I worked as a sysop for over 300 machines (including Mac, Windows/95/98/NT, Open/FreeBSD, and Linux) and over 800 user accounts. The tech industry was booming. I enjoyed being root.</dd>
<dt>2001</dt><dd>I joined a very small start-up coming out of Carnegie Mellon called Digital MC. We were able to tell how much you liked or disliked a song based strictly on analyzing the music of a playlist of songs you like. We completley ignored meta tags on the file. This was the first time I ever earned stock options, and I was earning them on a per hour basis as a contractor. We were hoping to be sold to Napster as they were dealing with how to survive after all the lawsuits yet they still had a large userbase to tap. This company no longer exists.</dd>
<dt>2002-2006</dt><dd>Dot-com industry crashes. I went into robotics research at both Carnegie Mellon University and The Johns Hopkins University, and worked for a government contractor as well. Security clearances helped with job security. Web world was obsessed with EJBs. I considered going into grad school for robotics but didn't.</dd>
<dt>2006-2008</dt><dd>I re-enter the start-up world joining Overture Technologies, writing automated student loan and mortgage underwriting software. During this time, most of our customers on the mortgage customers were subprime lenders, including Lehman Brothers. They went under whil I was still working there. Luckily, even though our customers were dropping like flies, so were our competitors. We became the only on alive for the few customers that were left. The student loan side did better, particularly through a partnership with <a href="http://www.hesc.ny.gov/">HESC</a>. The mortgage side of the company was later acquired by CompuGain Corporation. That barely made up for the bridge loans, and none of the stockholders saw any money from the sale.</dd>
<dt>2008-2009</dt><dd>I took a short stint at IMAKE Financial, which had just been acquired by Standard and Poor's. This was not a good year for Standard and Poor's. I did not have fun. I also learned a valuable lesson to never join a company where software engineers are not valued.</dd>
<dt>2009-2011</dt><dd>I joined webs.com, which is my favorite work environment to date. There I became the Technical Lead on the Platform. Although it is located right ouside of DC, it is the company that really felt like it understood the best parts about SF startup culture, all while able to do more east coast things like 401k matching. Webs was acquired for $117.5 million by Vistaprint.</dd>
<dt>2011-2013</dt><dd>I finally joined an actual San Francisco start-up: Scribd.</dd>
