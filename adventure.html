<p>It's true... 'Adventure' is my middle name. My partner and I got married at Burning Man in 2014. He decided to take my last name. Because name changing is such a pain, I decided that to make it fair, he should be allowed to pick my middle name. I promised that no matter how silly, inappropriate, or long it was, I would change it legally. As a result 'Adenture' is now my middle name and my wedding band is engraved with 'My Adventure'.</p>
